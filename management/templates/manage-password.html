	<h2>Manage Password</h2>
	<p>Here you can change your account password. The new password is then valid for both this panel and your email.</p>
	<p>If you have client emails configured, you'll then need to update the configuration with the new password. See the <a href="#mail-guide" onclick="return show_panel(this);">Mail Guide</a> for more information about this.</p>
